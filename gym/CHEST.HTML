      <p style="line-height: 30px;">Some people would contend this exercise doesn’t belong on a top-10 list for chest. They’ll either swear up and down that it trains the back, or they’ll belittle it as a relic once revered but now relegated to the training scrap heap because of its potential danger to the shoulders. The first group is right — it doubles as a fine back exercise. But for those who claim shoulder-impingement concerns, well, we’d instead argue that the problem isn’t the pullover; it’s the lack of flexibility prevalent in today’s gyms. If you don’t have full mobility in your upper back and delts, the pullover simply won’t feel comfortable. You need to work on that, and start doing this staple that served some of the best bodybuilders of all time, from Frank Zane to Arnold Schwarzenegger to Dorian Yates. 
Strengths: Most chest exercises fall into one of two categories: They involve pressing a weight (bending and extending at the elbows) or doing a flye motion (keeping your elbows fixed and closing and opening your arms in front of your body). The pullover is one of a scant few options that work the chest at a completely different angle, in a top-to-bottom contraction.

    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p style="line-height: 30px;">First, a clarification: When we say “pec-deck flye,” we are referring specifically to the version in which you bend your arms 90 degrees and put your elbows on pads. The other variant — in which you hold handles and your elbows roam free, which we refer to as a “machine flye” in this magazine — is certainly a fine exercise, but in our opinion, not quite on the same level. Why? The pec-deck places better focus on the all-important squeeze when you bring your arms in front of your body, causing the muscle fibers at the center of your breastplate to spring to full attention.Main Area Targeted: middle pecs
Strengths: When performed correctly, with arms in constant contact with the pads — a mental trick is to think of leading with your elbows — the pec-deck pits your pectorals directly against resistance while offering a broad range of motion and a reduced risk of injury when compared with free weights.
How-To: Sit with your lower back fully in contact with the pad and your feet flat on the floor. With your elbows at 90-degree angles and forearms flush against the pads, move your arms slightly forward to disengage the weight from the stack. From here, deliberately flex your pecs to bring the handles out in an arc until they meet in front of your body. Squeeze hard, then slowly return to the start, stopping when your upper arms are even with your torso, and repeat.

  <p style="margin-top: 100px;font-size: 40px;"> 3:CABLE CROSSOVER</p>
  <div class="container-fluid">

    <div class="col-md-8">
      <p style="line-height: 30px;">Wanna practice your “most muscular” pose? Join all the competitive bodybuilders out there and hit the cable-cross station for some flyes. Thanks to the cables, this single-joint movement allows for constant tension on the pecs. Our only concern? If you bend a little too much at the waist (a constant temptation when trying to squeeze heavy weights at the end of a taxing workout), you’ll shift the focus of the exercise from the lower pecs to the middle pecs. Not a bad thing, necessarily, unless you’re counting on the cable crossover to be the one exercise hitting that lower region.
Main Areas Targeted: inner pecs, lower pecs
Strengths: Cables offer a direct line of pull against resistance, and that resistance remains constant throughout the entire range of motion of the flye. When you do flyes with dumbbells, the pull of gravity wanes at the top, meaning it gets easier at just the point you want to squeeze the hardest. 
How-To: Stand in the direct center of a cable-cross station with your feet staggered, knees slightly bent and your focus forward, and grasp D-handles attached to the upper pulleys. Starting with your palms facing downward and elbows bent slightly, flex your pecs to draw the handles down and together, meeting below your waist. Try to keep your elbows up throughout the movement. Pause a moment for a peak contraction, then slowly allow the handles to return to the start position. Don’t let the weight stacks touch down between reps.

  <p style="margin-top: 100px;font-size: 40px;"> 4:DUMBBELL BENCHPRESS</p>
  <div class="container-fluid">

      <p style="line-height: 30px;">Fact: You could design a whole chest regimen out of nothing but dumbbells and a bench, and over the course of time build a strong, solid, formidable chest. Fact: Strengths: The press is more effective overall to build your pectorals, but it involves a concerted effort between pecs, delts and triceps. On the other hand, the flye (in all its variations) isolates the pecs by having them do exactly what they were intended to — bring your arms forward to the front of your body, forcing them to handle the load without assistance. So in the incline flye, you have a motion that directly engages the intended muscles, and by performing it on an incline, you’re further pinpointing the all-important upper-chest region.
How-To: Lie on a bench set to a 30- to 45-degree angle with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, and extend your arms above your chest, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows. Slowly lower the dumbbells in a wide arc down to your sides. Stop when your elbows reach shoulder level and reverse the motion.
