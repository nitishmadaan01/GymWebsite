		<h2 style="color:white; ">Education</h2>
<p style="color:white; ">You can get most, if not all, of the fitness benefits a gym offers in the privacy of your own home. Using calisthenics, simple free weights, resistance bands or a home gym, you can improve your strength, endurance and
 cardio function, and lose weight in your living room, basement or other workout area. One purpose of a gym 
is to help you learn new exercises, techniques and training methods to meet your weight-loss, muscle building, heart health or sports performance goals. Whether you get tips from staff, hire a personal trainer or ask other members for advice, the education you get at a gym might be more valuable than the workouts you perform there you could otherwise do at home. Many fitness centers offer a variety of classes led by professional instructors. Some offer nutrition counseling sessions with a registered dietitians.</p>

<h2 style="color:white; ">Motivation</h2>
<p style="color:white; ">
Sticking with a fitness program is essential because a few weeks or months of exercise won’t offer lifelong health benefits. Paying for a gym membership, joining and exercising with a friend, seeing others exercising and being pushed by a trainer can motivate you to keep coming back to your gym and continuing your workouts. Many cardio machines offer data that let you see your improvement in heart rate and calorie burning during workouts, further encouraging you to continue.
</p>
<h2 style="color:white; ">Socialization</h2>
<p style="color:white; ">
Meeting other people, working out with a partner, learning new things and generally interacting with a large number of people is an attractive aspect of gym membership for many people. For some, the chance to get out of the house and mingle with others, even for a few minutes here and there, is important. Some people consider a gym a likely place to meet potential dating partners because of their shared interest in health and fitness.
</p>
<h2 style="color:white; ">Facilities</h2>
<p style="color:white; ">
While you can get a very effective workout at home, a gym offers a wider variety of exercise options than most people can afford in their houses. Free weights, cardio machines, a track, swimming pool, sauna, basketball court and workout classrooms combine to give you workout options that can help you prevent a plateau through variety of exercise.

 <div class="container-fluid">

 		<div class="col-md-8">
 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">Some people would contend this exercise doesn’t belong on a top-10 list for chest. They’ll either swear up and down that it trains the back, or they’ll belittle it as a relic once revered but now relegated to the training scrap heap because of its potential danger to the shoulders. The first group is right — it doubles as a fine back exercise. But for those who claim shoulder-impingement concerns, well, we’d instead argue that the problem isn’t the pullover; it’s the lack of flexibility prevalent in today’s gyms. If you don’t have full mobility in your upper back and delts, the pullover simply won’t feel comfortable. You need to work on that, and start doing this staple that served some of the best bodybuilders of all time, from Frank Zane to Arnold Schwarzenegger to Dorian Yates. 
Strengths: Most chest exercises fall into one of two categories: They involve pressing a weight (bending and extending at the elbows) or doing a flye motion (keeping your elbows fixed and closing and opening your arms in front of your body). The pullover is one of a scant few options that work the chest at a completely different angle, in a top-to-bottom contraction.

 		<div class="col-md-4 chest2 zoom">
 			
 		</div>
 		<div class="col-md-8">
 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">First, a clarification: When we say “pec-deck flye,” we are referring specifically to the version in which you bend your arms 90 degrees and put your elbows on pads. The other variant — in which you hold handles and your elbows roam free, which we refer to as a “machine flye” in this magazine — is certainly a fine exercise, but in our opinion, not quite on the same level. Why? The pec-deck places better focus on the all-important squeeze when you bring your arms in front of your body, causing the muscle fibers at the center of your breastplate to spring to full attention.Main Area Targeted: middle pecs
Strengths: When performed correctly, with arms in constant contact with the pads — a mental trick is to think of leading with your elbows — the pec-deck pits your pectorals directly against resistance while offering a broad range of motion and a reduced risk of injury when compared with free weights.
How-To: Sit with your lower back fully in contact with the pad and your feet flat on the floor. With your elbows at 90-degree angles and forearms flush against the pads, move your arms slightly forward to disengage the weight from the stack. From here, deliberately flex your pecs to bring the handles out in an arc until they meet in front of your body. Squeeze hard, then slowly return to the start, stopping when your upper arms are even with your torso, and repeat.

	<div class="container-fluid">
 	<div class="row">
 		<div class="col-md-4 chest3 zoom">
 			
 		</div>
 		<div class="col-md-8">
 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">Wanna practice your “most muscular” pose? Join all the competitive bodybuilders out there and hit the cable-cross station for some flyes. Thanks to the cables, this single-joint movement allows for constant tension on the pecs. Our only concern? If you bend a little too much at the waist (a constant temptation when trying to squeeze heavy weights at the end of a taxing workout), you’ll shift the focus of the exercise from the lower pecs to the middle pecs. Not a bad thing, necessarily, unless you’re counting on the cable crossover to be the one exercise hitting that lower region.
Main Areas Targeted: inner pecs, lower pecs
Strengths: Cables offer a direct line of pull against resistance, and that resistance remains constant throughout the entire range of motion of the flye. When you do flyes with dumbbells, the pull of gravity wanes at the top, meaning it gets easier at just the point you want to squeeze the hardest. 
How-To: Stand in the direct center of a cable-cross station with your feet staggered, knees slightly bent and your focus forward, and grasp D-handles attached to the upper pulleys. Starting with your palms facing downward and elbows bent slightly, flex your pecs to draw the handles down and together, meeting below your waist. Try to keep your elbows up throughout the movement. Pause a moment for a peak contraction, then slowly allow the handles to return to the start position. Don’t let the weight stacks touch down between reps.

 		<div class="col-md-4 chest4 zoom">
 			
 		</div>
 		<div class="col-md-8">
 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">Fact: You could design a whole chest regimen out of nothing but dumbbells and a bench, and over the course of time build a strong, solid, formidable chest. Fact: Strengths: The press is more effective overall to build your pectorals, but it involves a concerted effort between pecs, delts and triceps. On the other hand, the flye (in all its variations) isolates the pecs by having them do exactly what they were intended to — bring your arms forward to the front of your body, forcing them to handle the load without assistance. So in the incline flye, you have a motion that directly engages the intended muscles, and by performing it on an incline, you’re further pinpointing the all-important upper-chest region.
How-To: Lie on a bench set to a 30- to 45-degree angle with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, and extend your arms above your chest, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows. Slowly lower the dumbbells in a wide arc down to your sides. Stop when your elbows reach shoulder level and reverse the motion.

 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">Stick with the conventional deadlift on back day; other variations, like the popular sumo-style, increase the activity of muscle groups other than the back.[1]
In your workout: If you're going heavy (sets of fewer than about 6 reps), do deadlifts first so you're fresh. If you're doing deads for repetitions, you can do them later in your workout.

In your workout: Do bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges, about 6-8 or 8-10. The Smith version is a suitable substitute; it locks you in the vertical plane, but your body has to be in just the right position relative to the bar. The bent-over barbell row has a significantly greater lumbar load than many other back exercises, so it's best done early in your workout in order to save your lower back.[2] If you're wrecked from deadlifts, it may behoove you to skip this movement.>Wanna practice your “most muscular” pose?

Why it's on the list: It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling movement in your back routine, and the pull-up is one of the best. Wide-grip pull-ups are excellent for putting emphasis on the upper lats. A closer grip may allow for a longer range of motion, but it may be possible to load the wide-grip pull-up to a greater degree because of an optimized starting joint position. The biggest challenge here for most trainers is training to failure in the right rep range for growth, which is 8-12.

 you do pull-ups early in your workout, you might have to add a weighted belt. Of course, if you find them difficult, you can always use an assisted pull-up machine or a good spotter, or switch to the wide-grip pull-down, which is a solid substitute. If your shoulders are healthy, pulling behind the head is okay.
Good form is extremely important here. In the starting position, the scapula should be retracted—pull your shoulder blades down and toward each other—prior to initiating the pull.

 		<div class="col-md-4 backk3 zoom">
 			
 		</div>
 		<div class="col-md-8">
 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">  Why it's on the list: We selected the T-bar row over a chest-supported version because you can pile on much more weight here, even though that typically translates into a bit of cheating through the knees and hips. For some, maintaining a flat back can be challenging, in which case the supported version is a better choice.
These aren't squats, so keep your legs locked in a bent angle throughout. You also typically have a choice of hand positions and width. A wider grip will put more emphasis on the lats, while a neutral grip will better target the middle back (rhomboids, teres, and traps). This exercise is probably one of the easier rows to spot.
 
These aren't squats, so keep your legs locked in a bent angle throughout.
In your workout: Do this toward the front half of your workout. Rather than slinging weight around with this movement, really focus on the stretch and contraction of the back. If you're an experienced lifter, load up with 25s instead of the 45s, and further increase range of motion by allowing a slight protraction of the scapula at the bottom of every rep. If you do this, be sure to "reset" with a flat back before initiating the next pull!
5. Wide-Grip Seated Cable Row
Why it's on the list: Just about everyone defaults to the close-grip bar on rows. If that sounds like you, you'll find using a wide grip on a lat bar a nice change of pace because it shifts some of the emphasis to the upper lats. Wide rows mimic some back machines, so don't do both in your workout unless you make some other kinds of changes, like grip or target rep range. You might even try flipping your grip—and going about shoulder-width apart—which better targets the lower lats as the elbows stay tighter to your sides.

		<div class="container-fluid">
 	<div class="row">
 		<div class="col-md-4 back4 zoom">
 			
 		</div>
 		<div class="col-md-8">
 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">Why it's on the list: Since we've already covered the wide-grip pull-up, the wide-grip pull-down is too similar, so we opted for the close-grip handle for our pull-down selection. EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip, so you're not missing out on any muscle fibers.[3] As mentioned earlier with pull-ups, a closer grip does allow for a longer range of motion and increased time under tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle. Why it's on the list: Reverse-grip movements mean two things: The biceps play a greater role, and with the elbows now pulling back close to your sides, the target becomes the lower portion of the lats. The Smith machine allows you to concentrate only on pulling as much weight as possible, since you don't have to worry about balancing it.
In your workout: This exercise can make a good warm-up move for your shoulders, but when used as a mass-building exercise, it's best placed toward the end of your workout for sets of 8-12 reps.
Slow down the rep tempo on these, squeeze hard at the bottom of each rep, and allow a good stretch at the top.

Bend over about 45 degrees, staying close to the bar, and expect a little contribution from the hips and knees when you're pounding out the heavy sets. While some gym rats consider the Smith machine taboo, the fixed plane of the movement and ability to really control a weight (think tempo of four seconds up and four down) can be both a novel and humbling exercise.
In your workout: You don't need more than a single reverse-grip movement in your routine. Do it about midway through your workout, after your heavy overhand pulls. At any point in your back workout, don't be afraid to throw on some wrist straps. Your goal is to hammer your back and put it through the wringer, not be constantly limited by your grip strength.

Whether you're a bodybuilder or just someone looking to get stronger in your presses, it's worth your time to add some size to the back of your arms.
You can put together a hundred different triceps routines by fine-tuning variables like exercise choice and order, rep ranges, intensity, volume, and rest periods. But rather than making you sit down to try and figure all of that out, I've done the work for you here with six straightforward and effective triceps workouts.
Each is a bit different from the others based on your training experience and goals. Each one includes movements from the large family of triceps exercises—close-grip bench presses and dips, skullcrushers, press-downs, overhead extensions, and kick-backs—that focus on one or more of the

The largest head of the three, the lateral is also the one away from your midline, so that makes it the outermost on your arm. Focusing on the lateral head is a great way to bring variety to your workout or target it if it's particularly lagging.

You can hit it with multijoint or single-joint movements, but the ones in which your arms stay by your sides work best, particularly with an overhand grip.

Whether you're a bodybuilder or just someone looking to get stronger in your presses, it's worth your time to add some size to the back of your arms.
You can put together a hundred different triceps routines by fine-tuning variables like exercise choice and order, rep ranges, intensity, volume, and rest periods. But rather than making you sit down to try and figure all of that out, I've done the work for you here with six straightforward and effective triceps workouts.
Each is a bit different from the others based on your training experience and goals. Each one includes movements from the large family of triceps exercises—close-grip bench presses and dips, skullcrushers, press-downs, overhead extensions, and kick-backs—that focus on one or more of the

 			<p style="line-height: 30px;">This exercise also stretches the long head of the biceps. The more horizontal the bench during your workout, the more the long head of the muscle will be stretched during reps.
These are awesome to add into your isolation workout because they truly isolate the biceps muscle!
 
Incline Inner-biceps curl
EXERCISE 3 Standing Concentration Dumbbell Curl
Concentration curls place the arm in front of the body with a bent elbow and a rotation in the shoulder. While this decreases recruitment of the long head, it potentially increases biceps thickness and peak by better recruitment of surrounding muscles during your workout.
With your free hand on your off leg to support your body weight, when you hit failure you can switch over to a hammer grip and burn out a few extra reps.
EXERCISE 4 EZ-Bar Curl
A lot of people think the EZ-bar curl is the best all-around addition to your biceps workout. It engages both the short and long heads of the biceps muscle and for some people it's a lot more comfortable on the joints and forearms than a straight barbell!

<h1>How Can Beginners Overcome Intimidation?</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">It has been proven by multiple psychologists that beginners can be intimidated by mirrors in the gym. In fact, one particular study published by The Journal of Health Psychology showed that a majority of beginner lifters, whether confident in their body or not, had at least minor concerns when forced to exercise in front of a mirror.
This leads back to the beginning of this article when I referenced commercial gyms interest in attracting new members. If beginner lifters are deterred from a gym with an abundance of mirrors then are these gyms really concerned about bringing in beginner lifters, or just those with more experience?</p>
<div class="about2 zoom"></div>
	<p style="margin-top:-10px ;">
<p style="font-size:20px;"> The interesting part is that beginners in the gym tend to focus more on their body image than form, while experienced lifters have trained their minds to ignore body image and focus more on lifts and exercises. One piece of advice from psychologists to beginner lifters is to attempt to shift your focus to the latter rather than being concerned about your overall body image.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I personally believe that paying attention to your body image can be important as long as you use it for positive. If you are able to notice gradual changes in your body from week to week, mirrors can actually inspire you to keep returning to the gym. Just try to remember that you are not being judged, and you are your own worst critic.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">It has been suggested that gyms provide beginners a comfortable area to exercise with less or no mirrors present until you become experienced enough to use mirrors for attention to form. This may be a good tactic to ease new members into a large gym when they are initially uncomfortable. However, this could hinder experienced gym members experience and may not be the best idea.</p>
</p>		
<div class="about4 zoom"></div>
	<p style="margin-top:-10px ;">
		<p style="font-size:20px;">You may be wondering if mirrors are beneficial or not. That is for you to decide. Everyone uses mirrors in the gym for different purposes. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced gym goer mirrors may have their benefits.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I personally suggest putting them to use no matter your level in the gym. They have helped me avoid injury quite a few times. More often than not I catch myself lifting too heavy because I realize I have a lapse in my form.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">If you are uncomfortable with the mirrors, try avoiding them or moving to a central area and focusing on the lift you are performing rather than what you look like.</p>

<div class="about5 zoom"></div>
	<p style="margin-top:-10px ;">

<p style="font-size:20px;">There are many reasons a person joins a gym ranging from losing weight, being in community, building a nice physique, doctor's recommendation etc. At the end of it all, to truly achieve your goal, one needs to go beyond the physical factor(gyms) and look at other factors that might hinder the goal like social, emotional, spiritual and mental. Gyms only focus on the physical part, the training part which is cardio and strength. A person can join a gym for a month wanting to lose weight, all these factors can play a role in achieving the goal for example, when someone does 4 spinning classes a week, the person might expect to lose weight, that will depend on many factors like i mentioned before, Is she following a healthy diet, is she drinking enough water, emotional eating and stress.</p>
 
<p style="font-size:20px;">All I am saying is gyms can have all the expensive equipment but at the end of the day, gyms needs human touch. people who will go the extra mile for its customers and be empowered to deliver exceptional service with the factors i have mentioned above. All in all, if you are planning to join a gym, make sure you have a goal in mind and the gym have a supportive structure to meet your goal (a fitness team), who is empowered to deliver world class services. Making sure you understand that by setting your specific goal, other factors might come in to hinder your goal, factors that i mentioned above.</p>

In conclusion,

<p style="font-size:20px;">a gym is supposed to be a place which is a conducive environment that dedicate itself to its members through a journey of health and wellness. I think we need gyms to be visible and promoting a healthy lifestyle in a community, for example like having one of its personal trainers achieve a big goal by running the comrades (I recently did my first comrades marathon this year at the time of 11:30) by going an extra mile and being a good role model in its community. My goal is to be a fitness ambassador for Newcastle and i will be doing events to achieve that goal by aligning myself with charity and other organisations within the Newcastle municipality</p>

		<p style="font-size:20px;">Every person in the world would like to have a perfect body. In order to have a healthy and a strong body, people would need to consider going to a gym to work out. What do such people expect of a gym? Certainly, patrons would expect a wide selection of equipment available in a gym. Patrons would enjoy a well-educated staff who knows everything people want to know about working out. The Bally Total Fitness, located on the Boulevard, is a perfect match for that. Patrons will definitely enjoy working out at the Bally Total Fitness. What kind of environment would patrons expect? Patrons will find the Bally Total Fitness clean, well organized, and suitable for working out.
             First of all, patrons will appreciate a wide selection of equipment available to them. Whether they like to use machines or free weights to achieve their goals, Bally Total Fitness is right for them. For example, patrons have a choice of inclined, declined, and regular bench press available to them. The gym has about 8 machines for each part of the body. The gym has 3 machines of the same kind, so patrons don't have to wait for someone to get finished with their work out. Bally's has about 5 set of dumbbells for each weight, so up to 5 people can work out at a time. Patrons will appreciate the wide selection of equipment offered to customers.
             Second of all, patrons would enjoy the staff, who can assist them with their work out. The Bally Total Fitness has 12 trainers on duty at a time.

Trainers can also design a healthy diet for one to follow. </p>
